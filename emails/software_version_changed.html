<h1>New Firmware Version on your Dishy</h1>
<p>There is a new version of firmware on your dishy. We thought you might want to know</p>
<p>
  Previous Firmware: {{ previousFirmware }}<br />
  New Firmware: {{ pewFirmware }}
</p>
<p>
  NiceDishy is still collecting data on this version to identify is there's an noticable change to performance or any cool new features to be aware of.<br />
  There's nothing you need to do right now.
</p>

<p>Thanks,
  <br>Marc</p>
