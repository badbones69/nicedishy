<h1>Welcome to NiceDishy!</h1>
<p>I appreciate your patience as I'm working to get NiceDishy out of private beta. It's been a lot of work to iron out some rough edges to make NiceDishy a great service.</p>
<p>The service is still in beta, but I'd love to have you send some data from your device and let me know if NiceDishy is useful.</p>
<p>I've moved your account from the waitlist queue into an active account. To get started, just click the button below to log in:</p>
