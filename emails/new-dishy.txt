Almost there. You've added your Starlink on NiceDishy.com, and now all you need to do is install our tiny agent to shuttle some info about your dish to our service.

Click the "Download" link on NiceDishy.com and follow the instructions there. If you need some help, check out our docs at https://docs.nicedishy.com/getting-started.

If you need some help, feel free to >email me directly at marc@nicedishy.com. Or post over in the r/starlink subreddit, I'm there constantly too!

Thanks,
Marc
