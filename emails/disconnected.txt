Uh oh, is everything ok?

We've been getting regular checkins from your Dishy, telling us how it's working, how fast it is, and more.

But something seems to have happened, and we haven't heard from your Dishy since {{ lastMetricAt }}.

If this is unexpected, check out out troubleshooting guide at: https://docs.nicedishy.com/troubleshooting

If you need some help, feel free to >email me directly at marc@nicedishy.com. Or post over in the r/starlink subreddit, I'm there constantly too!

Thanks,
Marc
