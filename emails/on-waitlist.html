<p>Thanks for signing up for NiceDishy! </p>
<p>Right now, the service is still in private beta while we iron on a few issues and make sure it's ready. I'll send you an email just as soon as your invite is ready.</p>
<p>I don't anticipate the wait will be too long, so stay tuned over the coming days. In the meantime, I've added you to my occaisional email list about the service.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:marc@nicedishy.com">email me directly</a>. Or post over in the r/starlink subreddit, I'm there constantly too!
<p>Thanks,
  <br>Marc</p>
