Thanks for signing up for NiceDishy!

Right now, the service is still in private beta while I iron out a few issues and make sure it's ready. I'll send you an email just as soon as your invite is ready.

I don't anticipate the wait will be too long, so stay tuned over the coming days. In the meantime, I've added you to my occaisional email list about the service.

If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:marc@nicedishy.com">email me directly</a>. Or post over in the r/starlink subreddit, I'm there constantly too!

Thanks,
Marc
