Welcome to NiceDishy
******************

I appreciate your patience as I'm working to get NiceDishy out of private beta. It's been a lot of work to iron out some rough edges to make NiceDishy a great service.

The service is still in beta, but I'd love to have you send some data from your device and let me know if NiceDishy is useful.

I've moved your account from the waitlist queue into an active account. To get started, just click the button below to log in:

https://nicedishy.com/login

Once you've logged in, you'll see some instructions to download our agent and install it locally.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me directly (marc@nicedishy.com). Or post over in the r/starlink subreddit, I'm there constantly too!

Thanks,
Marc

P.S. Need immediate help getting started? Check out our help documentation ( https://docs.nicedishy.com ). Or, just reply to this email.
