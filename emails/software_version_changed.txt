There is a new version of firmware on your dishy. We thought you might want to know

Previous Firmware: {{ previousFirmware }}
New Firmware: {{ pewFirmware }}

NiceDishy is still collecting data on this version to identify is there's an noticable change to performance or any cool new features to be aware of.
There's nothing you need to do right now.

Thanks,
Marc
