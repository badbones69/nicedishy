# FAQ

#### How much does NiceDishy cost?

NiceDishy is and will remain free. 

#### The Starlink app has remote monitoring, why is NiceDishy better?

This is a new feature that's been introduced in the Starlink app. This feature only works if you have the Starlink router (round dish) or the rectangular dish. In addition, this doesn't provide alerts or speed tests from your device when you are remote. 
The value of NiceDishy is that we can run these speed tests regularly and allow you to see if your device is performing at the same levels as others.

#### Why are my speed so slow?

#### Is there a Starlink outage?

One of the side effects of tracking this data for so many devices is that we can start to detect when there are outages. Check the outages map on the site to understand if there are any suspected or confirmed outages.

#### Will using this violate my ToS with Starlink?

We aren't reverse engineering or doing anything even remotely evil on your network or dish. We won't ship software or changes that put your service at risk in any way. We've had zero reports of anyone having problems from SpaceX from using NiceDishy and will report here if this changes.
