# Prepare for Dishy

Preordered or just recently ordered a Starlink device? This page exists to give you some information about what to expect and what to think about as you get set up.

Of course, head over to and join [r/starlink](https://reddit.com/r/starlink) for the best Dishy community.

## Is this a clear enough view of the sky?

Probably not :). The device needs a completely clear view of the sky, and any obstructions will likely cause problems. Recently (late 2021, early 2022), obstructions cause less and less problems, but they do exist still.

I have relatively minor obstructions with some trees that have grown a little taller, and I don't experience problems streming or browsing the web like this. But it's noticable when zoom freezes or I lose an SSH connection to a remote server.

Here's a screenshot of my current obstruction view from the iOS app:

## What accessories should I buy?

1. Masonry kit to bring the cable through the wall
2. A mount
  1. Volcano mount



## Help! I can't find a place to mount the device.


## Who can help me install Dishy?

We've seen people reach out and find professionals who have installed the Starlink device on a roof. A few places advertise this specific service, but I'm here to talk about alternate options too.

For relatively simple installs (mount to a roof or [fascia board](https://wizehomedirect.com/what-is-fascia-board-soffit/)), my recommendation for the non-DIY is to hire a roofer. I called my local roofing company and one of the roofers came over that afternoon to install. It cost me $150, and I'm hoping that the installer understands how to prevent leaks. Obviously there's not a warranty on his work since I hired him on the side to do the installation, but I'm still confident he knows what he's doing.

For complex installations such as on a tall mast or tree, it's going to take more work to find someone. These projects are often more DIY.
