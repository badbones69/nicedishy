# Notifications

NiceDishy will send notifications when certain activity is detected. You can opt out of any of these notifications on the settings page of your device.

You can disable all notifications using the toggle at the top of the page, or control each notification setting separately.

#### Firmware Upgrade

We will send you an email when the firmware version on your device changes. Starlink doesn't currently provide release notes, so we will include a link to any known changes (new features, performance changes, etc).

#### Device Offline

If a longer then usual timespace elapses and we haven't heard from your device, we'll let you know.

#### Performance Change

When we see a sustained change in the performance characteristics of your device (download speed, upload speed, latency, etc), we will send you an email. Speed changes constantly, so we hold off on sending these until we see a change that's persisted for a while.

#### Weekly Stats

We also send you a weekly summary of your device performance. This just includes the fastest (and slowest) speeds, averages, and some data to help you understand how your device is comparing to others.
