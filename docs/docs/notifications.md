# Notifications

NiceDishy will send notifications when certain activity is detected. You can opt out of any of these notifications on the settings page of your device.

You can disable all notifications using the toggle at the top of the page, or control each notification setting separately.

#### Firmware Upgrade

The service will send you an email when the firmware version on your device changes. Starlink doesn't currently provide release notes, so it will include a link to any known changes (new features, performance changes, etc).

#### Device Offline

If a longer then usual timespace elapses and the service hasn't heard from your device, we'll let you know.

#### Performance Change

When there's a sustained change in the performance characteristics of your device (download speed, upload speed, latency, etc), a notification will be sent via email. Speed changes constantly, so it will hold off on sending these until there's been a change that's persisted for a while.

#### Weekly Stats

The service will also send you a weekly summary of your device performance. This just includes the fastest (and slowest) speeds, averages, and some data to help you understand how your device is comparing to others.

#### Suspected Outage In Your Area

When devices in a geographic area all starts reporting high latency or drop offline, the service can assume that the area is experiencing a service outage. We'll email you and let you know when this is detected, and when it's resolved.
