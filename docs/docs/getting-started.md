# Getting Started

Connecting your Starlink dish to our service is pretty easy.

### 1. Sign up

Visit https://nicedishy.com/signup and create your account.

### 2. Wait for a notification that you are off the waitlist

Sorry for the delay here. We are working fast and you'll have a brief wait to get removed from the waitlist. If you want quicker access, ask in the r/starlink subreddit! 

### 3. Name your device. 

We recommend just using a city name, but feel free to use whatever you want here.

### 4. Download and install our agent software

Follow the instructions on the site here.

### 5. Connect the agent to the device

That's it! At this point, you will be sending metrics to our servers and will be automatically subscribed to notifications.
